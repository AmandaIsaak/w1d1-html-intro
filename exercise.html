          I am <strong>so excited</strong> about building a webpage. I am looking forward to <span style="color: #B8860B;"> customizing the look </span> of my website and creating unique features for my website visitors. 
        </p>

          I don't think that this blog will have very much to do with cats or cute kittens, but since they seem to go <strong>viral</strong> on the internet, maybe that is a good strategy for gaining a loyal following... 
        </p>

          I would <em>rather</em> write a blog about day-to-day life; my musings, adventures and favourite recipes! But I could include kitten (and puppy!) photos <em>just</em> to keep readers interested. Stay tuned for the cutest baby animals you ever did see, interspersed with simple life lessons.

          Happy Reading!
